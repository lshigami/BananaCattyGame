# BananaCattyGame

BananaCattyGame is a fun and exciting game where you collect bananas while avoiding bombs. Collect 20 bananas to win, but be careful - if you touch 3 bombs, you lose!

This is my first game created with Unity, and it's a great way to get familiar with the application.

## How to Play

Use the arrow keys ( "A" to move Left and "D" to move right) to move your character around the screen. Collect bananas to increase your score, but watch out for bombs - if you touch them, you'll lose a life. If you lose all 3 lives, the game is over.
