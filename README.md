# BananaCattyGame

BananaCattyGame is a fun and exciting game where you collect bananas while avoiding bombs. Collect 20 bananas to win, but be careful - if you touch 3 bombs, you lose!

This is my first game created with Unity, and it's a great way to get familiar with the application.

## How to Play

Use the arrow keys to move your character around the screen. Collect bananas to increase your score, but watch out for bombs - if you touch them, you'll lose a life. If you lose all 3 lives, the game is over.

## Features

- Fun and addictive gameplay
- Simple controls
- Challenging obstacles

## About

This game was created as a way to learn and experiment with Unity. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it!
